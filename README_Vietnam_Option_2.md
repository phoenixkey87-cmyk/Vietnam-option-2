# Vietnam Option 2: Key's 40th Birthday Experience

A standalone luxury travel itinerary site for November 21-29, 2027 (Da Nang, then Ho Chi Minh City). The original itinerary (`vietnam_itinerary_site.html`) is untouched and linked from the nav, hero and footer.

Everything on the site is a proposal. Nothing is booked. Items that could not be verified are labelled Estimated, Proposed or Pending confirmation.

## How to run

Open `Vietnam_Option_2.html` in a browser, or serve the folder:

```
python -m http.server 8000
```

then visit `http://localhost:8000/Vietnam_Option_2.html`. There is no build step and no API key.

## Structure

```
Vietnam_Option_2.html
vietnam-option-2/
  css/styles.css, print.css
  js/app.js        core: nav, theme, hero, countdown, itinerary, wishlist, print
  js/sections.js   hotels, dining, nightlife, cafes, shopping, wellness
  js/budget.js     budget planner
  js/map.js        Leaflet map
  js/verify.js     verification list and photo credits
  js/data/         content as plain scripts (window.VO2_DATA.*)
  js/vendor/leaflet/  Leaflet 1.9.4 with its LICENSE and marker images
  images/          locally stored licensed photos
```

## Editing content

Each file in `vietnam-option-2/js/data/` assigns a list to `window.VO2_DATA`: `itinerary`, `hotels`, `dining`, `nightlife`, `cafes`, `shopping`, `medical`, `mappoints`, `budget`, `credits`. Every record has `status` (verified, estimated, proposed or pending), `sourceUrl` and `checkedDate`. Set an unknown field to `null` and the page shows "Pending confirmation". When you verify something, update the value, set `status` to `verified`, and add the source and date. To add a photo, put it under `images/` and add a matching entry in `credits.js`.

## Booking, reservation and inquiry links

Hotels, dining, nightlife and wellness records may carry a `bookingLinks` list. The renderer in `js/sections.js` turns each entry into a Book, Reserve or Inquire button, and shows a muted "Booking link pending verification" label when the list is empty or missing. Do not invent URLs, affiliate codes or prices.

```
bookingLinks: [
  { kind: "book",            // "book" | "reserve" | "inquire"
    via: "official",         // "official" site/engine, or "ota" (then set otaName, e.g. "Booking.com")
    url: "https://...",      // https only; anything else is not rendered
    check: "fetched",        // "fetched" (responded) or "unverified-by-bot" (blocks bots; confirmed from search results)
    checkedDate: "2026-11-02",
    datesIncluded: "2027-11-21 to 2027-11-24",  // optional; only when the URL date format is proven to work
    note: "Shown under the buttons." }          // optional
]
```

Rules used: official booking page or official contact/reservation page first. A Booking.com page is used only when search results show it is the exact property. Dates go in a URL only where the format was confirmed (currently the Fusion Resort booking engine only). Links open in a new tab with `rel="noopener noreferrer"`, and each button's accessible name includes the property and says it opens in a new tab. Each section also carries a short note that links lead to external sites and that November 2027 rates and availability must be checked there.

The flight helper reads `window.VO2_DATA.flightSearches` (in `data/itinerary.js`): `from`, `to` (airport codes), `date` and `label`. It builds a Google Flights search link and is a search only, never a booking.
